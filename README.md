# Design

## Design choices

This site  will be visited by pet owners, nature enthusiast as well as business owners who want to advertise their product to increase their sales and therefore the site needs to cater for all these customers. The site should look professional with friendly and playful/creative tone and include photo examples.

## Colour scheme

The main colors of the website are black, golden yellow and slightly brighter shades of those colours. Black colors were used in order to indicate professionality and elegance while gold was used to add a bit of contrast in order to catch the visitor's eye while at the same time this warm color indicate  playfulness and evokes positive feeling about the services offered. 
Text color is mainly black for better contrast. White, yellow and brighter shades of yellow were used to emphasise certain text or for better contrast on dark background.

## Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the fonts chosen for this website.

Lato was used as a general font for the website. Acme was used for headers, emphasised words and to keep with the playful and friendly theme. San seriff was added in case browser doesn't support the other two fonts.

## Bugs

### Solved bugs 
 |  Expected |  Bug |  Fix |
 |  :---| :---|  :---|
 |  Hero image should be directly under the header | Header went over the hero image | Height property in navigation bar was updated  to 100% and that pushed the image lower |
 |The website should fit the width of a respective viewport | The scroll bar appeared at the bottom so it was necessary to move right and left to view the whole content. This was due to 'About section' was going over the set viewport width | Margin of  'About section'  was set to 0
 |Footer should cover the whole bottom of the page | There was a white space under the footer which was cause by the content of reviewer-boxes in 'Review section' overflowing | The height of the review-background was adjusted to give the text more space. The review-container was adjusted as well to fit the section without excessive free space |
 | Hamburger menu items should be centred | The menu items were all starting from the same level on the left which made portfolio to stick out | The parent navigation menu list was given display property with value block. The children a elements were given property display with value flex and justify content property with value centre which aligned the links into the middle of the screen |
 | When users of smaller screen touch the options from Hamburger navigation menu it should change the color of the whole screen from left to right | There was a space on the left when the color changed due to the ul element in header section had padding applied | Padding left property for ul element was removed |
 |  Two review boxes should get smaller when the viewport gets smaller and text should align accordingly | For the viewports under 411 px header and star rating were getting  distorted and the letters as well as stars were getting under each other and lost original alignment | Parent container was of the header and start rating was updated to block and  header and star rating were given display property with  value flex which pushed these two elements  under the picture |
 | The checkbox for the photo type selection should get stacked under each other on the devices which are narrower than 800px | The checkboxes inputs and the labels were not aligned neither vertically or horizontally |  The checkbox inputs were wrapped into the unordered list and displayed as a block

## Code
For hambuger navigation menu I took inspiration from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXze-haVm7g), and I adjusted the code heavily in order to fit the needs of my website

## Effect
The grey style effect on the pictures was taken from [W3C](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_effects.asp)

##Project Overview
Yasmin is a devoted photographer who has been capturing beautiful moments as well as beautiful places since 2005. Her love for nature and animals has not only became the main focus of her photography but it is a great inspiration for the majority of her photos. She uses natural features to complement the final photo of products her customers want to sell. She is keen on sharing her enthusiasm with others who would like to create lasting memories of their pets or places they love as well as those whose aim is to get attractive images of their product for promotional purposes.
